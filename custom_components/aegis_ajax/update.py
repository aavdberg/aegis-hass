"""Update entities for Ajax hubs (read-only — #123 follow-up).

Surfaces the pending firmware update the Ajax cloud has queued for the
hub. The entity is informational only:

- No `install` feature is declared, so HA renders no install button.
- `async_install` is not implemented.
- Ajax controls update scheduling server-side; the cloud pushes updates
  to the hub on its own cadence. This integration deliberately never
  calls the install RPC even though the proto exposes one — firmware
  updates are higher-stakes than the rest of the surface and the user
  should manage them via the official app if they want to force one.

The Ajax stream doesn't carry the currently-installed firmware version,
so `installed_version` stays `None`; HA still renders the entity as
"<latest> available" with a progress bar when downloading.
